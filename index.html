              <h2>Leader of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI)</h2>
              <p>  <b>Imran Ahmed Khan Niazi HI(M) PP</b> (Urdu: عمران احمد خان نیازی; born 5
                October 1952) is a Pakistani politician and former cricketer who
                served as the 22nd Prime Minister of Pakistan from August 2018 to
                until April 2022. He is the <b>founder and leader of Pakistan
                  Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI).</b> Born to a Niazi Pashtun family in Lahore, Khan
                graduated from Keble College, University of Oxford, England, in 1975.
                He began his international cricket career at age 18, in a 1971 Test
                series against England. Khan played until 1992, served as the team's
                captain intermittently between 1982 and 1992,[5] and won the 1992
                <i>Cricket World Cup</i>, in what is Pakistan's first and only victory in the
                competition.  Founding the PTI
                in 1996, Khan won a seat in the National Assembly in the 2002 general
                election, serving as an opposition member from Mianwali until 2007.
                PTI boycotted the 2008 general election and became the second-largest
                party by popular vote in the 2013 general election.[13][14] In the
                2018 general election, running on a populist platform, PTI became the
                largest party in the National Assembly, and formed a coalition
                government with independents with Khan as Prime Minister.
